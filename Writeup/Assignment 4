Prateek:
future.h (this header file defines the future structure which is used to synchronize the processes)
future_alloc.c (this file creates a future and initializes FUTURE_EXCLUSIVE flag)
future_cons.c (consumes the value present in the "value" variable of future when the state is FUTURE_VALID using future_get())
xsh_prodcons.c ("prodcons -f" is used in this program to invoke the future part)

Siddharth Jain:
future_prod.c (produces a random vlaue and sets the value in fture using future_set())
future_free.c(frees the memory of that particular future)
future_get.c (Get the value of a future set by an operation and change the state of future from FUTURE_VALID to FUTURE_EMPTY)
future_set.c (writes a value to the "value" variable of future if the state !=FUTURE_VALID and after writing changes the state of that future to FUTURE_VALID)
