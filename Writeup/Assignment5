future_alloc.c (this file creates a future(with get, set queues;semaphore initialized ) and initializes FUTURE_EXCLUSIVE flag)
future_cons.c (consumes the value present in the "value" variable of future when the state is FUTURE_VALID using future_get())
xsh_prodcons.c ("prodcons -f" is used in this program to invoke the future part)

Siddharth Jain:
