**Description & Learning:
Helped understand the higher level concepts of file system.

-fs_open
*Checks if requested file exists on the file system
*Checks if file is already open in the file table entries
*If file is not already open, creates file table entry and returns the index it

-fs_close
*Change the file table entry flag corresponding to the given file

-fs_create
*creates a indode and intializes it elements
*creates a direntry for the corresponding file in root folder
*writes all the changes to disk
*opens the file and returns file descriptor of it

-fs_seek
*resets the file pointer to given offset if possible

-fs_read
*refers the file table entry and determines the block to be read and the corresponding offset
*reads the block into block cache
*copies the corresponding content into buffer, which is to be returned

-fs_write
*refers the file table entry and determines the block to write to and the corresponding offset
*reads the block into block cache
*writes the data to it
*writes the block cache data to disk
